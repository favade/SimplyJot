# SimplyJot

One Screen journaling web app.
Uses sessions to store user data

In Order to get full credit I also created a CLI application here: https://github.com/favade/SimplyJotCLI

Struggled with the connection with the backend and frontend through the web app and without login authention it also made it harder for me to save user data
